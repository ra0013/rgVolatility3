Volatility 3 GUI

modify the "config.json" file to match your volatility install locations.
you will need to know where your "python.exe" and your "vol.py".
your default directory must be the directory where "vol.py" is located.
backslashes "\" must be double backslashes "\\" in the filepaths.  This is 
demonstrated in the "config.json" also.
